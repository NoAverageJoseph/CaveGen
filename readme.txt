drawNoWaterBox - doesn't draw the blue waterboxes
drawNoFallType - doesn't draw the falltype indicators
drawNoGateLife - doesn't draw the gate's life
drawNoObjects - doesn't draw any objects
findGoodLayouts 0.01 - runs a heuristic to only output images for the best 1% of layouts
requiredMapUnits unitType,rot,idFrom,doorFrom,doorTo;... - only outputs maps such that
	for the ith entry in this semicolon separated list, the ith map unit generated
	has this unit type and rotation, and is attached at the door with id doorTo 
	to the map unit with id idFrom at the door with id doorFrom

EXAMPLES:
java -jar CaveGen.jar seed story -seed 0x12345678 -drawSpawnPoints
  This generates images of all levels in story mode with that seed.
java -jar CaveGen.jar cave BK 4 -num 100 -seed 0 -consecutiveSeeds
  This generates images for 100 instances of BK4, checking seeds following 0.
java -jar CaveGen.jar none CH12 0 -num 10000
  This generates stats for 10000 instances of concrete maze, no images.
java -jar CaveGen.jar caveinfo.txt 0
  This generates the whole caveinfo.txt cave

9 Blue        = alcove


FALLING KEY:
0 nothing = not falling
1 purple  = fall if anything near
2 blue    = only fall if pikmin near
3 red     = only fall if leader near
4 orange  = only fall if pikmin carrying near
5 green   = only fall if a purple earthquake is nearby

If you want to learn about the spawning algorithm, you can read the code in CaveGen.java,
or watch this video: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/499998582
To test your understanding, try the quiz below:


QUIZ:
GENERAL QUESTIONS (for story mode)
1. What's the primary difference between the spawning algorithm in story mode and challenge mode?
2. Why is there a skewed distribution for the room that the pod spawns in?
3. Why is there a skewed distribution for the rooms that are used, despite the game's attempt to balance the rooms used?
4. What factors control how corridors spawn relatvie to rooms and alcoves?
5. What factors control how corridors branch out?
6. Can a corridor exist behind an alcove?
7. Where does the hole/geyser spawn?
8. What determines which and where enemies (possibly containing treasures) spawn?
9. Where do treasures (not in enemies) spawn? How does ordering matter? Which enemies matter?
10. What determines where enemies in alcoves spawn? How does ordering matter?
11. How do gates prioritize their spawning? If you see a gate between two rooms, what does that tell you about the alcoves?
12. Which direction does the camera face at the start of a sublevel? 
13. How does the view during the comedown relate to view from pressing L at the start of the sublevel?
14. From how far away does the treasure gauge pick up a treasure?

SUBLEVEL KNOWLEDGE
15. In HoB 1, the probability that the treasure spawns in a room instead of an alcove is 9/16. Why?
16. Where do the mitites spawn in HoB 4?
17. In HoB 4, the card spawns in the spiral room if and only if there is a fire geyser or bulborb in the spiral room. Why?
18. Why does the hole sometimes appear not in an alcove in WFG 2? Is the probability of this occurance 1/8?
19. On SH 2, how can you tell if you have a mum or a flower, based solely on the location?
20. On SH 2, why does the strawberry never spawn in the water? Is the same true for the sushi and why?
21. How can you tell which bulborb holds the treasure in BK 1, without using the gauge?
22. What factors determine how many purple flowers spawn on BK 4?
23. If you've found the tape in SCx 1, what does that tell you about the location of the Nouveau Table? How about vice versa? What other sublevels does this logic extend to?
24. What is the probability of having to do rimwalk on SCx 5?
25. Why does the bolt in particular sometimes spawn close on SCx 6?
26. When does the hole spawn in a corridor in SCx 8?
27. Can a treasure spawn in a corridor in FC 3? How can you tell if you are in a corridor?
28. Why do the treasures sometimes spawn close on FC 4?
29. Why does the exit sometimes spawn close on FC 6?
30. On CoS3, if you see a gate with nothing visually behind it, what does that tell you? Why?
31. On GK4, the odds of high invigorator are 27.6%, while the odds of high chocolate are 28.8%. Why are these different?
32. Why does the treasure sometimes not spawn on SCx7? SC4? GK3? CoS4? How are all of these cases different?
